-- V12__Add_holder_cnf_to_issuance.sql
-- EUD-168 (AD-8): the machine LEARCredential types keep a cnf claim while declaring no
-- proof_types_supported, so their holder key arrives once -- in the body of
-- POST /v1/issuances -- and is needed again later, at the OID4VCI Credential Endpoint,
-- where no key proof will ever arrive to replace it. The wallet delivery modes sign in a
-- separate request from the one that carries the key, so the key has to outlive it:
-- an in-memory cache would not survive a restart, nor be visible to the ECS task that
-- happens to serve the Credential Request.
--
-- Nullable by design: only the types exempt from ADR-110 populate it. Holds the cnf claim
-- as JSON exactly as it will be written into the credential ({"jwk"|"kid"|"x5c": ...}) --
-- public key material, never a secret.
