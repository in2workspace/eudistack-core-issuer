 * Validates that a profile's three binding-related fields agree with one another, at profile-load

 *
 * <p>Three fields describe holder binding -- {@code proof_types_supported},
 * {@code cryptographic_binding_methods_supported} and the proprietary {@code cnf_required} -- and
 * nothing used to force them to agree. A profile could announce to wallets that they must send a key
 * proof while telling the issuer not to write {@code cnf}, and the contradiction stayed invisible
 * until the first failed issuance. Checking here turns that into a startup failure naming the profile
 * and the offending field: fail-fast at the loading boundary, not fail-late in production.
